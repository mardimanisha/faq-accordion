## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for interactivity

### What I learned

During this challenge, I focused on making the FAQ accordion both functional and accessible. Here are a few things I learned:

- Semantic HTML: Using button, section, and article elements appropriately to improve accessibility.
- CSS Transitions: Implementing smooth transitions for the accordion opening and closing.
- Responsive Design: Creating a responsive layout that adapts to both mobile and desktop screens using media queries.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to explore more advanced accessibility features, such as implementing ARIA roles and live regions. Additionally, I aim to refine my CSS Grid skills for more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - ARIA: Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - This article helped me understand how to use ARIA attributes effectively.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://www.example.com) - This guide was instrumental in setting up the layout for this project.
